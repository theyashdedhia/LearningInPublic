        Data Structures

Stack - 
    LIFO
    Uses - Functional Call Stack, Undo Mechanism, Backtracking, Syntax Parsing
    "from queue import LifoQueue
    stack = LifoQueue(maxsize=0)"

Queue -
    FIFO
    Uses - Task Scheduling, BFS
    "from queue import FifoQueue
    queue = FifoQueue(maxsize=0)"

Dequeue - 
    Enqueue and Dequeue possible from both ends

Priority Queue - 
    Dequeue based on Priority

LinkedList - 
    Each nodes store 2 values. Data and Pointer
    Insertion O(1)
    Deletion O(1)
    Search O(n)

Doubly LinkedList - 
    Each node store 3 values. Data, Pointer to previous node and Pointer to next node
    Linear retrival time

Array - 
    Continuous memory allocation
    Constant retrival time
    Fixed Size (Resizing is expensive)

Graph - 
    Represented using Adjacency List or Adjacency Matrix

Set -
    Unique values, order is not important
